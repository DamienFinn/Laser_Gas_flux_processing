Laser gas flux processing script

This code measures gas fluxes from portable, continuously-generated laser-derived data.
With an input mapping file, users define the start and end times to measure fluxes of
interest. A linear model is fit between start/end time points. As disturbances to gas
chambers can generate erroneous gas measurements, the script also removes outlier 
measurements from the beginning and end (dependent on a window defined by the user); fluxes
are calculated from linear models fit to the raw data and the cropped data. Users are
provided with fluxes, slopes, R2 and p values for raw and cropped data. 

Plots of raw and cropped linear model fits, and the residuals of the models, are also given.

Fluxes are calculated as:
Flux mg m2 h-1 = (lm slope (ppb sec-1) * gas MW * vol (L) * pressure (kPa) * 3.6)/(R * (temp (C) + 273.13) * 1000 * Area (m2))

and

Field Corrected Flux mg m2 h-1 = 
((vol (L)/((101.325/pressure (kPa))*22.4*((temp (C) + 273.13)/298.15)))/Area (m2))*(lm slope (ppb sec-1)/1000) * gas MW * 3.6 


Note that additional metadata (temperature in Celsius, gas chamber dimensions, atm pressure 
kPa) are required for flux calculations. 


Finally, an output that is compatible with the R package "flux" is also provided for comparison.
